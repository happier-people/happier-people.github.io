# Make people happier!

This project was developed as a part of NASA Space Apps Challenge 2017. It provides visualization on happiness degree in different countries (carefully calculated, based upon a bunch of scientific metrics), and provides (hopefully) useful advices about ways of improving the situation.

This is frontend part; for backend, take a look at https://github.com/Mefgalm/HappyPeople

This was designed for Github Pages, but you can easily deploy it locally (use any web-server to serve root folder), for example, like this:

```
http-server -p 4040 -c-1 ./
```
