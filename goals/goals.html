        Web-project Happy People has been created to help make world better. There are 3 important functions that are presented in this project:
        <ol class="ol-list">
            <li>
                User friendly visualization of happy index and its components in different countries.
            </li>
            <li>
                Find out what component considerably influenced on happy index.
            </li>
            <li>
                Recomendations on how to increase happy index according to low criterias.
            </li>
        </ol>
        One of the pleasant things in this project, nice helper ‘Supp’ who will be with you during your map investigation and help to find out all index details in particular country.
        Our web project was built with the help of jVectorMap technology with ability to create clickable map.
        Also, happy index was calculated based on 12 characteristics, which try to figure out the ‘measure’ of happiness. All characteristics are normalized and brought to the one common index.
